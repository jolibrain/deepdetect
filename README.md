## DeepDetect : Open Source Deep Learning Server & API

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/beniz/deepdetect](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/beniz/deepdetect?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

DeepDetect (http://www.deepdetect.com/) is a machine learning API and server written in C++11. It makes state of the art machine learning easy to work with and integrate into existing applications.

DeepDetect relies on external machine learning libraries through a very generic and flexible API. At the moment it has support for:

- the deep learning library [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)
- distributed gradient boosting library [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost)
- the deep learning and other usages library [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org)
- clustering with [T-SNE](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/Multicore-TSNE)

#### Templates

DeepDetect comes with a built-in system of neural network templates (Caffe backend only at the moment). This allows the creation of custom networks based on recognized architectures, for images, text and data, and with much simplicity.

Usage:
- specify `template` to use, from `mlp`, `convnet` and `resnet`
- specify the architecture with the `layers` parameter:
  - for `mlp`, e.g. `[300,100,10]`
  - for `convnet`, e.g. `["1CR64","1CR128","2CR256","1024","512"], where the main pattern is `xCRy` where `y` is the number of outputs (feature maps), `CR` stands for Convolution + Activation (with `relu` as default), and `x` specifies the number of chained `CR` blocks without pooling. Pooling is applied between all `xCRy`
- for `resnets`:
   - with images, e.g. `["Res50"]` where the main pattern is `ResX` with X the depth of the Resnet
   - with character-based models (text), use the `xCRy` pattern of convnets instead, with the main difference that `x` now specifies the number of chained `CR` blocks within a resnet block
   - for Resnets applied to CSV or SVM (sparse data), use the `mlp` pattern. In this latter case, at the moment, the `resnet` is built with blocks made of two layers for each specified layer after the first one. Here is an example: `[300,100,10]` means that a first hidden layer of size `300` is applied followed by a `resnet` block made of two `100` fully connected layer, and another block of two `10` fully connected layers. This is subjected to future changes and more control.

### Authors
DeepDetect is designed and implemented by Emmanuel Benazera <beniz@droidnik.fr>.

### Build

Below are instructions for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. For other Linux and Unix systems, steps may differ, CUDA, Caffe and other libraries may prove difficult to setup. If you are building on 16.04 LTS, look at https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/issues/126 that tells you how to proceed.

Beware of dependencies, typically on Debian/Ubuntu Linux, do:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libgoogle-glog-dev libgflags-dev libeigen3-dev libopencv-dev libcppnetlib-dev libboost-dev libboost-iostreams-dev libcurlpp-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev protobuf-compiler libopenblas-dev libhdf5-dev libprotobuf-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev liblmdb-dev libutfcpp-dev cmake libgoogle-perftools-dev unzip
```

#### Default build with Caffe
For compiling along with Caffe:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

If you are building for one or more GPUs, you may need to add CUDA to your ld path:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
```

If you would like to build with cuDNN, your `cmake` line should be:
```
cmake .. -DUSE_CUDNN=ON
```

To target the build of underlying Caffe to a specific CUDA architecture (e.g. Pascal), you can use:
```
cmake .. -DCUDA_ARCH="-gencode arch=compute_61,code=sm_61"
```

If you would like a CPU only build, use:
```
cmake .. -DUSE_CPU_ONLY=ON
```

If you would like to constrain Caffe to CPU only, use:
```
cmake .. -DUSE_CAFFE_CPU_ONLY=ON
```

#### Build with XGBoost support

If you would like to build with XGBoost, include the `-DUSE_XGBOOST=ON` parameter to `cmake`:
```
cmake .. -DUSE_XGBOOST=ON
```

If you would like to build the GPU support for XGBoost (experimental from DMLC), use the `-DUSE_XGBOOST_GPU=ON` parameter to `cmake`:
```
cmake .. -DUSE_XGBOOST=ON -DUSE_XGBOOST_GPU=ON
```


#### Build with Tensorflow support
First you must install [Bazel](https://www.bazel.io/versions/master/docs/install.html#install-on-ubuntu) and Cmake with version > 3.

And other dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install python-numpy swig python-dev python-wheel unzip
```

If you would like to build with Tensorflow, include the `-DUSE_TF=ON` paramter to `cmake`:
```
cmake .. -DUSE_TF=ON
```

If you would like to constrain Tensorflow to CPU, use:
```
cmake .. -DUSE_TF=ON -DUSE_TF_CPU_ONLY=ON
```

You can combine with XGBoost support with:
```
cmake .. -DUSE_TF=ON -DUSE_XGBOOST=ON
```

#### Build with T-SNE support

Simply specify the option via cmake command line:
```
cmake .. -DUSE_TSNE=ON
```

### Run tests

Note: running tests requires the automated download of ~75Mb of datasets, and computations may take around thirty minutes on a CPU-only machines.

To prepare for tests, compile with:
```
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ..
make
```
Run tests with:
```
ctest
```

### Start the server

```
cd build/main
./dede

DeepDetect [ commit 73d4e638498d51254862572fe577a21ab8de2ef1 ]
Running DeepDetect HTTP server on localhost:8080
```

Main options are:
- `-host` to select which host to run on, default is `localhost`, use `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces
- `-port` to select which port to listen to, default is `8080`
- `-nthreads` to select the number of HTTP threads, default is `10`

To see all options, do:
```
./dede --help
```

### Pure command line JSON API

To use deepdetect without the client/server architecture while passing the exact same JSON messages from the API:

```
./dede --jsonapi 1 <other options>
```

where `<other options>` stands for the command line parameters from the command line JSON API:

```
-info (/info JSON call) type: bool default: false
-service_create (/service/service_name call JSON string) type: string default: ""
-service_delete (/service/service_name DELETE call JSON string) type: string default: ""
-service_name (service name string for JSON call /service/service_name) type: string default: ""
-service_predict (/predict POST call JSON string) type: string default: ""
-service_train (/train POST call JSON string) type: string default: ""
-service_train_delete (/train DELETE call JSON string) type: string default: ""
-service_train_status (/train GET call JSON string) type: string default: ""
							  
```

The options above can be obtained from running

```
./dede --help
```

Example of creating a service then listing it:

```
./dede --jsonapi 1 --service_name test --service_create '{"mllib":"caffe","description":"classification service","type":"supervised","parameters":{"input":{"connector":"image"},"mllib":{"template":"googlenet","nclasses":10}},"model":{"templates":"/path/to/deepdetect/templates/caffe/","repository":"/path/to/model/"}}'
```

Note that in command line mode the `--service_xxx` calls are executed sequentially, and synchronously. Also note the logs are those from the server, the JSON API response is not available in pure command line mode.
