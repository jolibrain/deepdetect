# Open Source Deep Learning Server & API

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/beniz/deepdetect](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/beniz/deepdetect?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

DeepDetect (https://www.deepdetect.com/) is a machine learning API and server written in C++11. It makes state of the art machine learning easy to work with and integrate into existing applications. It has support for both training and inference, with automatic conversion to embedded platforms with TensorRT (NVidia GPU) and NCNN (ARM CPU).

It implements support for supervised and unsupervised deep learning of images, text, time series and other data, with focus on simplicity and ease of use, test and connection into existing applications. It supports classification, object detection, segmentation, regression, autoencoders, ...

And it relies on external machine learning libraries through a very generic and flexible API. At the moment it has support for:

- the deep learning libraries [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe), [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org), [Caffe2](https://caffe2.ai/), [Torch](https://pytorch.org/), [NCNN](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) and [Dlib](http://dlib.net/ml.html)
- distributed gradient boosting library [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost)
- clustering with [T-SNE](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/Multicore-TSNE)
- similarity search with [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy/) and [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)

Please join either the community on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/beniz/deepdetect), where we help users get through with installation, API, neural nets and connection to external applications.

## Templates

DeepDetect comes with a built-in system of neural network templates (Caffe backend only at the moment). This allows the creation of custom networks based on recognized architectures, for images, text and data, and with much simplicity.

Usage:
- specify `template` to use, from `mlp`, `convnet` and `resnet`
- specify the architecture with the `layers` parameter:
  - for `mlp`, e.g. `[300,100,10]`
  - for `convnet`, e.g. `["1CR64","1CR128","2CR256","1024","512"], where the main pattern is `xCRy` where `y` is the number of outputs (feature maps), `CR` stands for Convolution + Activation (with `relu` as default), and `x` specifies the number of chained `CR` blocks without pooling. Pooling is applied between all `xCRy`
- for `resnets`:
   - with images, e.g. `["Res50"]` where the main pattern is `ResX` with X the depth of the Resnet
   - with character-based models (text), use the `xCRy` pattern of convnets instead, with the main difference that `x` now specifies the number of chained `CR` blocks within a resnet block
   - for Resnets applied to CSV or SVM (sparse data), use the `mlp` pattern. In this latter case, at the moment, the `resnet` is built with blocks made of two layers for each specified layer after the first one. Here is an example: `[300,100,10]` means that a first hidden layer of size `300` is applied followed by a `resnet` block made of two `100` fully connected layer, and another block of two `10` fully connected layers. This is subjected to future changes and more control.
